#This project utilizes the following Superstore data: 

CREATE TABLE superstore (
    item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    item_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    average_rating DECIMAL(3, 2)
);

SELECT *
FROM superstore
LIMIT 5;

#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT price, item_name
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

SELECT COUNT(item_name)
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name="Memory Foam Mattress";

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies";

#Show how many Slow Cookers are in stock.
SELECT stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name="Slow Cooker";
